# GunGame

This project is completly based on OOPs concept like Inheritence and Method overriding.

-> In this game we have 2 different players 'Player1' and 'Player2' with their helth(100).
-> We have two different Guns also 'Sniper'(Damage 50) and 'Pistol'(Damage 10).
-> Player2 had an advantage that he has an armor to defend himself or to reduce the damage.
-> Both player can heal themseleve but only if only they have health more than 0.


Problem faced :

I build player1 very easily, But when i started building player2 then there was a problem to menage the damage with armor or without armor on player two,
with two different guns. And i solved that problem by my thinking capability and problem solving skill. It tooks almost 3hrs to build whole game.
